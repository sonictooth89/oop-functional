# OOP and Functional Programming Basket

This repository contains two files with code: one for object-oriented programming and the other for functional programming. The purpose of this project is to create a basket with products, where all products have a price and a count.

## File Structure

The project consists of two files:

- `oop.js`: This file contains the code for the object-oriented programming approach.
- `functional.js`: This file contains the code for the functional programming approach.

## Object-Oriented Programming

The `oop.js` file contains a class `Basket` that represents a basket object. The `Basket` class has methods to add products, remove products, and calculate the total price of the products in the basket.

The `Product` class is also defined in the `oop.js` file. This class represents a product object and has attributes for the price and count of the product.

## Functional Programming

The `functional.js` file contains functions to add products, remove products, and calculate the total price of the products in the basket. The functions use dictionaries to store information about the products, where the keys are the names of the products and the values are dictionaries with the price and count of each product.

## Usage

```
$ node oop.js
```
```
$ node functional.js
```
